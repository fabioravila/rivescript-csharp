# CSharp RiveScript Interpreter

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/crwboe7fa6aseqvc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fabioravila/rivescript-csharp/branch/master)
[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/fabioravila/rivescript-csharp.svg)](./LICENSE)

## SYNOPSIS

This is a C# implementation of a RiveScript interpreter, per the Working Draft
at http://www.rivescript.com/wd/RiveScript.html

This code was initially developed based on the official version of the Java interpreter
rivescript-java - https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-java

## MOTIVATION

As a C# developer sought a different mechanism of AIML + Program# for chatterbot due to
discontinuity or implementation of complication.
In seeking an alternative i came across the RiveScript that with its simplicity and syntax
made me choose this as my new chatterbot script.
As the C# interpreter announced the offical site is not functional, i have decided to make
the C# interpreter, based on the official Java code.

PS: This is my first public library, then I'm sorry for the lack of knowledge of some community standards.

## TASK LIST

- [x] Make a port of actual rivescript-java - Make a port of current Java code, 'shame on me =]'
- [x] Create some basic tests - based on RiveScript 'official' demos and myself
- [x] Push to github on public repository
- [x] Develop a native objects for csharp
- [x] Migrate last fixes and changes from rivescript-java since jan-2016 (some push a lot)
- [x] Create a RSBot Demo Script (By [Efface Studios](https://github.com/effacestudios/)) 
- [ ] Complete test based on rsts
- [ ] Complete the code documentation and adjust appveyor to build and release on tag
- [ ] [...]


## CODE STANDARDS
1. I put the methods with same name as Java lib (pascalCasing) to all imterpreters have same mehtod name
2. I like to use (false == condition) instead (!condition), becous i always miss the "!" out my vision
3. Do not use Linq, to make this code compatible with olders frameworks versions
4. [...]
